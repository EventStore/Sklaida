Sklaida
=======

This is a sample application around using EventStore. This sample app implements a scatter/gather pattern with the event store as the backend. The javascript client reads directly from atom feeds in order to update the UI for the result set in real time as results are returned from the adapters.

After building the backend can be run by running "ConsoleHost". The front end is a single page app and self contained. It can be run just by pointing your browser at index.html in the frontend folder.
